 * -- the feature is off, or the foreground cannot perform the action. In
 * tap-only mode the proxy forwards only the other button and suppresses the
 * eventual tap; otherwise it forwards the ordinary Menu chord to RetroArch.

 * only withholds its modifier from the core after input_hotkey_block_delay
