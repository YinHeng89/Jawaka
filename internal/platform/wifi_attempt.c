/* One auth failure is not a verdict. A network can span several access points
 * (an iPhone hotspot has shown up as two BSSIDs), and when one of them rejects
 * the association wpa_supplicant moves on to the next by itself: on MLP1 an
 * ASSOC-REJECT from one iPhone BSSID was followed 1.2 s later by a completed
 * connection through the other. Failing on the first one abandoned that join,
 * and the recovery that follows re-enabled every saved network while none was
 * current, so wpa_supplicant went straight back to the previous network. A
 * second failure means its own retry failed as well; otherwise the timeout
 * decides. */
