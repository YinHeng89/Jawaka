/* app-services-v1 (SVC-1) service supervisor: the piece that actually wires
 * the independent primitives into a working supervise-a-service loop.
 *
 * Normative source: plans/leaf-syncthing/contracts.md#svc-1--service-manifest
 * ("Supervision and process ownership", "Stop sequence", "When a stop cannot
 * be verified", "Restart policy") and #ctl-1--control-and-status-ipc.
 *
 * This module OWNS, per service id:
 *   - manifest revalidation from the on-disk pak.json (discovery);
 *   - the generation lease (internal/services/lease.c), held by the daemon
 *     for the whole generation;
 *   - process launch (internal/services/launch.c), the ownership
 *     reservation (internal/services/reservation.c), the stop sequence
 *     (internal/services/stop.c) over the group-absence check
 *     (internal/services/ownership.c), and the SVC-1 "do not reap the
 *     leader until the group is verified writer-free" rule;
 *   - restart backoff / circuit-breaker decisions
 *     (internal/services/backoff.c) and the persistent/session control
 *     state (internal/services/control_state.c).
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT do IPC framing or UI. The caller owns LIFE-1's
 * cooperative exchange; this layer owns the process-group stops, restart
 * latches, and daemon-wide start gate that make lifecycle decisions safe.
 *
 * REENTRANCY / THREADING: a jw_svc_supervisor is NOT thread-safe and every
 * public function must be called from the daemon's single main thread. The
 * one exception constraint flows the other way: jw_svc_supervisor_tick()
 * must run regularly (it polls child exit, lease re-acquisition once per
 * second while desired, backoff timers, and stop-sequence progress).
 *
 * BLOCKING: everything here is non-blocking EXCEPT the final stage of an
 * individual stop: after SIGKILL the group gets one synchronous bounded
 * verification of at most JW_SVC_STOP_KILL_WAIT_MS (2000 ms, the contract's
 * own worst case). jw_svc_supervisor_stop_service(),
 * jw_svc_supervisor_restart_service(), and jw_svc_supervisor_stop_all()
 * therefore return only after that bounded window; the daemon calls them
 * only where such a bounded wait is acceptable (shutdown, an explicit user
 * Stop/Restart, or a lifecycle trigger). Tick-driven stops
 * (leader-exit-with-live-descendants) escalate asynchronously so the main
 * loop never stalls.
